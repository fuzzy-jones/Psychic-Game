# Psychic-Game
In this application I created a phychic game where the application picks a random letter and the user has a certain amount of guesses to guess that letter.

## Instructions
The application will pick a random letter, which you will not know. You will then guess letters in hopes of picking the letter the app has generated. Once you run out of guesses the losses will increase by 1. If you guess the correct letter it will be tallied as a win. After a win or a lose, a new random letter will be generated. The game will continue to keep score until the page is refreshed.
